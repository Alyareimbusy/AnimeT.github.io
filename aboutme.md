subtitle: AAhhh its AI in news again!
---

My name is Deepak Bhatt. Everyday I sing up to the same song of Tensorflow to develop AI algorithms solving business specific problems. I like reading AI literatures (openreview.net is my holiday destination) and implementing them to solve problems at hand. Been worked at various capacity for following:

- Automotive Navigation
- Intelligent context determination
- Natural Language Processing
- AI in finance

What else do you need?

### Something I struggle with in new domain

Understanding data to understand business better and vice-a-versa and most importantly building pipeline to integrate data of various kind for training deep learning models. Rest is history; that comes with experience.
