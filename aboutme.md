Hey everyone glad seeing you landing to this page. Blessed to be in the era of great deep learning community of developers and researchers who gives us wing to apply their novel ideas to solve the business problems we work on. I enjoy reading AI literatures (such as openreview.net, arxiv) and implementing them to solve industrial problems at hand. Been worked at various capacity for following:

- Automotive Navigation
- Intelligent context determination
- Natural Language Processing
- AI in finance

What else do you need?

### Something I struggle with in new domain

Understanding data to understand business better and vice-a-versa and most importantly building pipeline to integrate data of various kind for training deep learning models. Rest is history; that comes with experience.

### How you can buy me
If something you can buy me over, is over a cup of coffee and your inquisitiveness to put AI to innovate
